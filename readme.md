# Kali-Clean

My kali desktop setup.

After cloning run ./install.sh from a non-root user in `/home/kali`. Will update kali and installs necessary tools, so it will take a while.

## Installation

``` sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

>***Note***: Installation may take a while, final step to install pentest_scripts repo (requires authentication = username + personal access token).
