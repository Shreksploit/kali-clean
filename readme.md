# Kali-Clean

My kali desktop setup.

After cloning run ./install.sh from a non-root user in `/home/kali`. Will update kali, install necessary tools and update configuration.

## Installation

Final step to install pentest_scripts repo requires authentication = username + personal access token as password.
The access token can be found on GitHub under: Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token > Scope: repo
